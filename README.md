# Annotating-MegaScript
A master set of tools for annotating boxes and labels in Zillin, specifically designed for the BYU-Idaho RBDC and Lineage Logistics

This script is designed in different modules, to make it much easier to debug and add or remove features to each. It is launched by running "Mega Script Launcher", which will then search for the other programs in the same directory.

Autohotkey is necessary to run this as of now. Once I'm closer to completion I'll compile this code into Windows Executables for general use. Unfortunately, a whole re-programming in a different language will be necessary for MAC and Linux support. I'll get to that when I can.

The goal of this Mega Script is to future-proof tools for the RBDC and the team as a whole. Major Features planned include:
* Creation of new projects completely from within a GUI interface
* Editing of existing projects completely from within a GUI interface
* Greater cross-project compatibility for Zillin interface calibrations
* Easier and more convenient opt-in features such as box corner marking, zooming, counters, etc.
